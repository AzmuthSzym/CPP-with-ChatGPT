# CPP-with-ChatGPT

## The idea behind it

One day I asked chatGPT to give me 20 exercises that I could do in order to improve my knowledge of different libraries in c++ std space. Here is the promt tha was generated:

Here are 20 examples of exercises that can help you learn the C++ Standard Library:

Write a program that uses the iostream library to read data from a file and display it on the screen.
Develop a program that uses the vector container to store a list of integers and sorts them in ascending order.
Create a program that uses the string class to read a sentence from the user and convert it to uppercase.
Implement a program that uses the algorithm library to search for a specific value in a vector.
Write a program that uses the chrono library to measure the time it takes to execute a piece of code.
Develop a program that uses the map container to store a list of words and their frequencies in a text file.
Create a program that uses the regex library to validate an email address entered by the user.
Implement a program that uses the thread library to perform a calculation in parallel.
Write a program that uses the filesystem library to list all the files in a directory.
Develop a program that uses the numeric library to calculate the sum of a list of numbers.
Create a program that uses the bitset class to perform bitwise operations on binary numbers.
Implement a program that uses the random library to generate a random password.
Write a program that uses the fstream library to write data to a file.
Develop a program that uses the iterator library to reverse the order of elements in a vector.
Create a program that uses the locale library to format numbers and dates according to the user's location.
Implement a program that uses the tuple class to store and manipulate a set of values.
Write a program that uses the queue container to simulate a line of customers at a store.
Develop a program that uses the unordered_map container to store a list of words and their frequencies in a text file.
Create a program that uses the bitset class to perform encryption and decryption on a message.
Implement a program that uses the atomic library to perform thread-safe operations on a shared variable.

In this repository I will try to complete them all - some may be in a different shape or form but I will try to document that as I go forward with these exercises.
